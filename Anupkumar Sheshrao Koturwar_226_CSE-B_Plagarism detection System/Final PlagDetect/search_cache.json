At the enterprise level, cybersecurity is key to overall risk management strategy, and specifically, cyber risk management . Common cybersecurity threats include ransomware and other malware , phishing scams, data theft and more recently, attacks powered by artificial intelligence (AI). As cyberthreats grow in sophistication and frequency, organizations are increasing their investments in prevention and mitigation. The International Data Corporation (IDC) projects that security spending will reach USD 377 billion by 2028.1 Cybersecurity Trends for 2025 and Beyond This evolving threat landscape has also fueled growth in the cybersecurity job market. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that “employment of information security analysts is projected to grow 32% from 2022 to 2032, faster than the average for all occupations.”2 Why is cybersecurity important? Cyberattacks and cybercrime can disrupt, damage and destroy businesses, communities and lives. Security incidents can lead to identity theft, extortion and the loss of sensitive information, impacts that can significantly affect businesses and the economy. By one esti mate, cybercrime will cost the world economy USD 10.5 trillion per year by 2025.3 But a more pertinent question may be: “ Why is cybersecurity especially important right now?” Today, cybercriminals are using new technologies to their advantage. For instance, businesses are embracing cloud computing for efficiency and innovation. But bad actors view this advancement as an expanding attack surface ripe for exploitation. Bad actors are also leveraging the dark web . According to the IBM X -Force 2025 Threat Intelligence Index , sophisticated threat actors, including nation -states, are using the anonymity of the dark web to acquire new tools and resources. They are demonstrating never -before -seen levels of coordination, automation and prowess — elevating risk from data breaches to widescale disruption. Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative. A successful cybersecurity approach has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe.",
